/*
 * Shared memory allocator class
 *
 * Provides two public functions like malloc and free
 *
 * shm_alloc(size): given size in bytes, allocate shared memory of given size, return pointer
 * - toggle current key
 * - allocate shared memory with new key
 * - mark new key as used, both in used[] and in the semaphore
 *
 * shm_free(ptr): given pointer, remove shared memory; do nothing if ptr is NULL
 * - find key associated to pointer
 * - increment semaphore
 * - asynchronously (calling wait_del):
 *   - wait for consumer to release key
 *   - mark key as unused
 *   - delete shared memory
